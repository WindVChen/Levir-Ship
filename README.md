## Introduction
![LEVIR-Ship](Dataset.png)

Images in **LEVIR-Ship** are captured from multispectral cameras of **GaoFen-1 and GaoFen-6** satellites with a spatial resolution of ***16m***. We only use the R, G, and B bands. 85 scenes have been collected in the dataset with pixel resolutions between 10000×10000 and 50000×20000. We crop the original images to finally get 1973 positive samples and 1923 negative samples with the size of 512×512. 

To our most knowledge, LEVIR-Ship is **the first public tiny ship detection dataset specific to medium-resolution remote sensing images**.

### Compared with high-resolution datasets 
![Resolution Visualization](Resolution.png)

Descriptions: Samples of 512 × 512 size from different datasets. (a) Samples from the airbus ship detection Competition dataset with a spatial resolution of ***2m and higher***. (b) Samples from the LEVIR-Ship dataset with a spatial resolution of ***16m*** (zoomed in for better visualization).

### Compared with other datasets 
| Dataset | Images Number |Instances Number | Source | Resolution | Year |

| NWPU VHR-10 | 57 | 302 | Google Earth | 0.5-2m | 2014 |
| HRSC2016 | 1070 | 2976 | Google Earth | 0.4-2m |  2016 |
| DIOR | 2702 | 62400 | Google Earth | 0.5-30m | 2018 |

| **LEVIR-Ship** | 3896 | 3219 | GaoFen-1 & GaoFen-6  | **16m** | 2021 |

### Examples of different situations

Images in LEVIR-Ship show very different conditions, due to the influence of different time, different photographers, and different locations, which can bring many challenges to the tiny ship detection task. In other words, LEVIR-Ship is much closer to the **real world situations**, compared to some Google Earth-based datasets whose images are usually clean and cloudless. Thus, LEVIR-Ship can bring networks **better generalization, stability, and sufficiency**.
